# Introduction

This will be a collection of various modding lessons, mostly revolving around how to read, use, and edit xEdit (SSEEdit and FO4Edit).

This project will be open source. I encourage anyone to contribute any knowledge they can to make this better for newcomers and veteran modders alike.

Please note: everything here **requires** a legitimately purchased copy of the game you are modding. Support for pirated versions of any games will not be provided.

## Modding Tools

  -  *More tools may be added as new lessons for them are developed.*

### xEdit

xEdit is a tool built for modding Bethesda Games, and is an all-encompassing term to refer to multiple programs, such as SSEEdit, TESEdit, and FO4Edit. They are all the same exact program. Renaming the .exe itself (or adding a custom argument when running the .exe) will allow it to be used on the game of your choice.

### Creation Kit

Official engine software released by Bethesda Game Studios. The Creation Kit is what is used to make the game in its entirety. Some time after release, Bethesda releases a stripped-down version of the CK for modders to use.

### Mod Organizer 2

Used for downloading, installing, organizing, and editing mods. Launches all installed files through a Virtual Directory in order to keep your game's installation folder as untouched as possible.

Tutorials here will assume you are using MO2, and are launching programs such as xEdit and the Creation Kit through MO2.
