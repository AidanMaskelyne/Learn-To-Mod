# Introduction

This will be a collection of various modding lessons, mostly revolving around how to read, use, and edit xEdit (SSEEdit and FO4Edit).

This project will be open source. I encourage anyone to contribute any knowledge they can to make this better for newcomers and veteran modders alike.

Please note: everything here **requires** a legitimately purchased copy of the game you are modding. Support for pirated versions of any games will not be provided.

## Modding Tools

### xEdit

xEdit is a tool built for modding Bethesda Games, and is an all-encompassing term to refer to multiple programs, such as SSEEdit, TESEdit, and FO4Edit. They are all the same exact program. Renaming the .exe itself (or adding a custom argument when running the .exe) will allow it to be used on the game of your choice.

### Creation Kit

Official engine software released by Bethesda Game Studios. The Creation Kit is what is used to make the game in its entirety. Some time after release, Bethesda releases a stripped-down version of the CK for modders to use.

### Mod Organizer 2

Used for downloading, installing, organizing, and editing mods. Launches all installed files through a Virtual Directory in order to keep your game's installation folder as untouched as possible.

#### More tools may be added as new lessons for them are developed.
