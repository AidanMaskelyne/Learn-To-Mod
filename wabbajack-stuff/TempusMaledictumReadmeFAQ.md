#### How do I dodge / what are the hotkeys in the MCMS?

Tempus Maledictum makes liberal use of MCM Helper and MCM Recorder. This means most things are set up for you. To help you along, here are the default hotkeys I use:

Toggle HUD - Mouse3.  
Dodge - Mouse4.  
Target Lock-on - F. (You can long-press F to change POV).  
Target Lock-on Swap - Mouse Wheel + Mouse movement. A bit less sensitive than the default value (32 > 50).  
Sneak - Left Control.  
Hold Shift - allows you to pick up books without reading them. Also lets you know if that book will be stolen or not.  
Right Alt - access Handy Crafting storage.
