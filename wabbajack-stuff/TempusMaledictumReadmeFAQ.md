## Tempus Maledictum Frequently Asked Questions

---

It's a new list. There are no frequently asked questions yet. But I have been in this business for a while now, so let's make some predictions.

---

#### Can I add [x] mod?

I don't know. I don't care. Don't ask me this.

---

#### Where's all the combat and animation overhauls?

Don't use 'em. I play in first person, animation mods annoy me, they're most likely responsible for the goddamn `skeleton.nif` crashes I've seen in various modlists over the years, and I don't want to deal with it. As for the combat stuff, I'm fine with things as they are now.

---

#### Everything is too bright, can you make it have some sort of *realistic immersive darkness?*

No. It's a video game. I want to see shit.

---

#### Is the world unleveled?

No.

---

#### I'm having an issue with bodyslide/armors looking funny/an awkward light source/some other minor inconvenience, please fix it?

No.
