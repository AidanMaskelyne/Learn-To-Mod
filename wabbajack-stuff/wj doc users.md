# Wabbajack for Users

### So what is Wabbajack anyway?

Wabbajack is an automated Modlist installer, making sharing your modded setups or installing the setups of others a more streamlined experience and giving list creators all the tools they need.

### Why is a program like this necessary?

Well, that part gets a little complicated. Bethesda's EULA states that modders own the work they create within the Creation Kit or any tools provided to the community by Bethesda Game Studios. This means people like you and me cannot reupload or redistribute these files. That's where Wabbajack comes in.

All files from a modlist are downloaded directly from the source. This means there is no redistribution of files, no sharing of assets, and nothing that violates the rights of any mod authors and creators.

### How does Wabbajack work?

That's also a bit complicated, but here's how we like to explain it:

Wabbajack is, in essence, a modding guide. The only real difference is that the guides written for Wabbajack are meant to be read by a machine instead of a human. Instead of spending days (or even weeks!) visiting mod pages, downloading files, installing, patching, and editing mods while following written instructions, Wabbajack performs all these tasks automatically on your machine.

Much of this workload is handled by something called **binary patching**. To keep this simple, this is most easily explained as such: Wabbajack identifies the files inside of the archives that have been downloaded, compares them to the files that need to be installed, and edits the source files to perfectly match the installed files.

More information about binary patching is available on the Developer page.

### Can a Wabbajack modlist require payment?

No. All original code in Wabbajack is given freely via the [GPL3 license](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wiki/blob/main/LICENSE.txt). Parts of Wabbajack use libraries that carry their own Open Sources licenses; those parts retain their original copyrights. The sale of modlist files is strictly forbidden, as is hosting the files behind any sort of paywall. You received this tool free of charge- please respect this by giving freely as you were given.
