BETA 3

Disabled various bushes, rocks, plants, and trees that were otherwise interfering with doors and landscape edits.  
Reinstalled and added various patches for Embers XD.  
Added Screenshot Helper.  
Removed Disable Snow Grass - For Vanilla and Cathedral Landscapes.  
Removed Dynamic Things.  
Added JS Shrines of the Divines.  
Added Double Bright Quick Light.  
Changed ENB screenshot key to Insert because it was pissing me off when I used Print Screen to take a screenshot and I would end up with two copies of every image.  
Updated Dyndolod Output.  

Known issues that were fixed:  
 - Markarth, Morthal, Falkreath, Solitude Skyway, Blue Palace Courtyard, and many other locations should have greatly reduced jank and clipping and whatnot. This does NOT mean I cleared every location or got every instance of any object that's placed incorrectly, but I definitely got a lot of them. This is the sort of thing that will take a long time.  
 - Fire pits should no longer have missing textures.  
 - Blackthorn's initial note should no longer be riddled with typos and grammatical errors.  
 - Screenshots SHOULD save properly now, in your `Stock Game\[NoDelete]Screenshots` path.  

If any of the items listed above are NOT fixed, please notify me immediately. It's a lot for one person to check...
