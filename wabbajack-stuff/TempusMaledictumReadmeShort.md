You've used Wabbajack before? You know how it works?

Cool. Let's do this.

Make sure you have Skyrim Anniversary Edition. Yes, this includes the recent $20 add-on. No, it is not negotiable.

Make sure it's a clean install of the game. No old mods in your data folder or anything like that. Delete it all and reinstall it.

Launch the game.

If you haven't already done this since purchasing AE, launch the game through Steam and allow Skyrim to download all the Creation Club files.

Close the game.

Open Wabbajack. Download Tempus Maledictum from the gallery.

Set the installation and download locations to blank folders. Shared downloads folders are fine if you have multiple lists installed.

Click the Play button.

Wait.

Did Wabbajack turn red and say `Installation Failed`? Unable to download a bunch of archives? Are all those archives called `Data_cc` with a bunch of other stuff? Then you need AE. Buy it. If you already bought it, launch the game and download it.  

Did Wabbajack turn green and say `Installation Complete`? Nice, let's go.

Open your installation folder.

Launch `ModOrganizer.exe`.

Does it say `SKSE` in the right hand side, next to that big RUN button? Yeah? Good. Click that big RUN button then.

Make your character. Select whatever options you want, it doesn't matter.

Have fun. I'm on [Discord](https://discord.gg/yABEjwB) if you need me.
