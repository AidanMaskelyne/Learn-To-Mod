You've used Wabbajack before? You know how it works?

Cool. Let's do this.

Open Wabbajack. Download Tempus Maledictum from the gallery.

Set the installation and download locations to blank folders. Shared downloads folders are fine if you have multiple lists installed.

Click the Play button.

Wait.

Did Wabbajack turn green and say `Installation Complete`? Nice, let's go.

Open your installation folder.

Launch `ModOrganizer.exe`.

Does it say `SKSE` in the right hand side, next to that big RUN button? Yeah? Good. Click that big RUN button then.

Make your character. Select whatever options you want, it doesn't matter.

Press Escape. Select `Mod Config`.

Do whatever you want because I haven't made MCM Configs yet.

Tab back out to the game.

Have fun. I'm on [Discord](https://discord.gg/yABEjwB) if you need me.
