# Let's Install a New Mod!

I've got my eye on [this Sanctuary overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/51148). Let's install it together and see what happens!

Note: the goal of this lesson isn't necessarily to install this particular mod, but rather to give you an idea of my workflow when I want to check out a new mod.

Go ahead and click the link above. Read the mod page, look at the pictures, check the stickied posts and bug reports. All of this information is likely useful. When you're ready, swap over to the Files tab and download the Main File and the Optional SS2 patch.

Install both in MO2. Activate both mods. You can leave them at the bottom of your load order for now.

Normally I'd jump straight into xEdit and do some poking around in there, but to be honest, I just want to see what this mod really looks like in-game. Boot it up!

You can use this `coc vault111ext` command for a pseudo-quick-start, since this isn't a "serious" save, but rather just a "test" game.

Ignore that big black bubble. If you walk into it, it'll trigger the little cutscene of you exiting the Vault.

I do however want clear weather as opposed to this dreary rain.

Much better. Onward to Sanctuary!

Hell of a difference already. Let's head down there and just look around, see if we find anything...off.

There's the trash can from my scrap mod floating in this kitchen. We will need to take care of that.

Open the console and click it, then take note of the RefID on the right. I just take a screenshot (like this one!) for future reference.

Well that bush looks ridiculous.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew9.png)

Remember to open the console and take a screenshot of its IDs.

None-the-less should be one word. Nonetheless. I am very particular...

Should be "Despite" and I don't know why "Construction" is capitalized. This is enough to convince me to look over all of the messages in the mod.

You can see what I mean about this bush being ridiculous.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew13.png)

Floating bushes. There are a lot of them in this area.

This strip of road looks weird as hell.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew17.png)

Well, that's about it for environmental stuff. Honestly, it's...a lot less than I was expecting, and the stuff I did find is incredibly simple to fix. For now, let's see how Codsworth treats the first turorial quest. This will give us a good idea of his pathing and the navmeshes in the city without needing to open the CK, because quite frankly I don't feel like doing that right now.  

Talk to Codsworth and start up the Out of Time quest. Do whatever you want, just see how it goes when you play it. Take notes of any issues you encounter.

Well, he got stuck a bit on the car outside my old house.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew18.png)

And now he can't really get into this house to fight the bloatflies. Looks like I should add some steps here later or something.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew19.png)

Definitely having a few issues navigating around the fences. He gets through eventually, but it makes me want to check the preferred paths in the navmeshes. Ughhhh.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew20.png)

God damn bushes.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew21.png)

Good, SS2 seems to be starting up just fine.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew22.png)

Alright, I think we've seen enough for now. This will give us a good head start on what to look for. Go ahead and close the game, then...you know what, I just decided to get rid of the Nice Bush mod. I [already wrote a lesson](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/e07a6252dfd7430e47dae75dcf67f5bc09f4b9ca/lessons/Remove%20a%20Master.md) on removing mods that are mastered to other mods (and it's quite a good lesson!) but that isn't necessary here. NXGEN Nice Bush can be deleted outright with no negative side-effects. So...I'm going to do that now.  

Yeet.

Anyway, launch xEdit.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew24.png)

Load all modules.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew25.png)

Wait until the Messages pane says `Background loader: finished`.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew26.png)

Let's do a few quick standard checks. Scroll to the bottom of the plugin list and find `[EA] SanctuaryHillsOverhual.esp`, take a moment to become infuriated that "Overhaul" is misspelled, then Right click > Apply Script.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew27.png)

Apply filter for deleted navs. Feel free to use the filter to make your life easier. I do.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew28.png)

Nothing of note was found. Perfect.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew29.png)

Let's run another check. Right click anywhere in the left pane and select Remove Filter.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew30.png)

Scroll back down to the atrociously spelled `SanctuaryHillsOverhual`, right click it, and select Check for Errors.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew31.png)

Nothing of note was found. Perfect x2.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew32.png)

Since we got rid of Nice Bush, all we really NEED to do right now is fix the trash can placement from This is Trash. There are two possible ways to do this, and both are acceptable:  
  -  Open the CK and move the trash can to a more appropriate place.  
  -  Set the trash can to Initially Disabled.  

Now when I was looking around, I noticed that the leaves and garbage piles weren't there anymore. I guess the author didn't like them either. So I will opt for Option B: disable the trash can. We don't really need it here.

If you recall, we took a screenshot of the trash can earlier, along with its ID. The one in my screenshot reads `d6051a61`. Type that into the FormID search bar at the top left of xEdit.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew33.png)

It turned red and beeped at me! Interesting. That ID doesn't exist. Let's scroll up and find `ThisisTrash.esp` in the plugins list. Should be just a bit above all the `Crafting-` patches.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew34.png)

Ah, there's the problem. Notice the FormID we search for starts with `D6` and ThisisTrash.esp is filed under `D7`. So all we have to do is change the 6 to a 7 in the ID we are searching for.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew35.png)

That's better. Note: this happens because there is an error in the load order right now. xEdit loads the plugins in the same way the game will, which is not necessarily the same order as MO2's plugins list. This case is a rare exception, however: the ID changed because I removed that Nice Bush mod, which was active when I took that first screenshot. Still not a bad idea to double-check my load order when this is done, though!  

Right-click the top of this record and select `Copy as override into`.

You can make a new patch if you want, or add it to an existing patch of your own. I will be adding it to `Lively's Tweaks.esp`. I don't really like making an entirely new plugin for one tiny change like this.  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew37.png)

You will be prompted to add `ThisisTrash.esp` as a Master. Click Yes. If the file isn't a master in the patch, then we can't use any records from that mod - meaning we can't disable or use this trash can in any way.

Double click the Record Flags field in Lively's Tweaks.esp for this record.

Select the `Initially Disabled` flag.

Close xEdit and save the plugin.

Let's launch the game and check on that trash can real quick.

Hell yeah! It's gone!  
![alt text](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/673826159856ef15543f72348edd36c461b31af1/images/installnew43.png)

Honestly, this is in a perfectly playable state as of now. The typos and small fixes with the road and the car can come at a later time. I think we'll call this a wrap. Thanks for reading, and I hope you learned something new!
